3_servo_arm    

    This is an AVR-C project that permits the user control of a claw arm 
operated by multiple DC servos through analog and digital input for the 
atmega328p.  The servos managing left, right, up, and down motion are controlled
via an analog stick while the claw is changed from being opened and closed via
pressing a button. 

    The project also provides an analog input module named analogIn.h.  Holding 
a few routines for turning on the atmega328p's Analog to Digital Converter(ADC), 
telling when to convert the analog input, and to change which analog input pin 
will be using the ADC.  These respectively being:

    void setupADC()

    void startConv()

    void changeInputPin(uint8_t pin);
